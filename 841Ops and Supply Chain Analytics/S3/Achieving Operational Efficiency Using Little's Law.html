That is, rather than undertaking analysis to determine how changes to resource allocations will impact operational performance, some managers take an iterative approach. A resource allocation will be implemented, the impacts observed, and the next iteration ensues. Frankly, that's not all that bright. A LOT of money is wrapped up in the resources supporting a process and so I think its reasonable to expect a competent manager to take the time to work out some analysis before implementing a specific resource application.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Little's</span></strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">&nbsp;<strong>Law</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Little's law is about as easy as a mathematical formula gets. It is typically presented in either of the following two ways:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;"><math title="" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mstyle> <mstyle mathsize="0.7em"> <mi>I</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mi>R</mi> <mo>×</mo> <mi>T</mi> </mstyle> </mstyle><annotation encoding="latex">{"version":"1.1","math":"\scriptsize I = R \times T"}</annotation></semantics></math></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;"><math title="" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mstyle> <mstyle mathsize="0.7em"> <mtext>Average Inventory</mtext> <mo>=</mo> <mtext>Average Flowrate</mtext> <mo>×</mo> <mtext>Average Flowtime</mtext> </mstyle> </mstyle><annotation encoding="latex">{"version":"1.1","math":"\scriptsize \text{Average Inventory} = \text{Average Flowrate} \times \text{Average Flowtime}"}</annotation></semantics></math></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">or in a shortened form where "Average" is implied but doesn't appear...</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;"><math title="" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mstyle> <mstyle mathsize="0.7em"> <mtext>Inventory</mtext> <mo>=</mo> <mtext>Flowrate</mtext> <mo>×</mo> <mtext>Flowtime</mtext> </mstyle> </mstyle><annotation encoding="latex">{"version":"1.1","math":"\scriptsize \text{Inventory} = \text{Flowrate} \times \text{Flowtime}"}</annotation></semantics></math>Ideally, our process flowrate is matched to the market demand rate and so, the flowrate isn't something that is typically controlled. That leaves us with two "levers". By observation of the above formula, if the Flowtime is longer, the inventory level increases; and vice-versa.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Why This Matters</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">The meaning of "Inventory" in this equation can take on a variety of different meanings. In queuing theory, it might represent the number of patients waiting in a clinic waiting room. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">In the manufacturing and production sectors, it typically represents WIP. This is something that costs our employer money. </span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">At the macro-level, "Inventory" might represent supplies sitting in storage room or spare parts in a warehouse aren't free. I have to buy them, and then pay for the storage facility.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Conversely, in a different application, "Inventory" might represent the WIP at a process stage, a buffer, or across a process at-large.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">In any case, inventory costs me a lot of money. As an operations manager, I'd generally like to reduce my inventory costs. So how do I do that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Little's Law gives us the answer. If the flowrate isn't something I can change, but I want to reduce the inventory level, then my only recourse is to reduce the process flowtime. This demands a process that is agile and nimble, where a unit of production enters the process, spends limited time idle anywhere in the process, operations are completed quickly, and then the unit of production quickly exits the process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">That's very easy to say but sometimes difficult to implement. Common strategies include line assemblies (where buffers are virtually non-existent), modular design, parallel processing (multiple tasks simultaneously happening on a single unit of production), and redesigning our facility to reduce the transportation time WIP might spend moving around inside our facility.&nbsp;</span></p>
