<ol>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">How much stuff should I buy?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">When should I buy that stuff?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Decades of research have been invested in answering those two questions and, consequently, we have a variety of models that can be applied depending on the context.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Deterministic Models</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Consider the case where there is limited or no variability in the demand rate. Recalling your first year economics class, such commodities include those with&nbsp;<em>inelastic demand</em>. That is, the demand rate is insensitive to the commodity's price. For example, many prescription medications for chronic illnesses have relative static demand rates (e.g., insulin for diabetes or high blood pressure medication). Food items and unprocessed agricultural items tend to also have static demand rates (bread, cereals, grains, rice, salt, etc.). Many petroleum products can also be modelled as a static demand rate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">The most common deterministic model is the&nbsp;<em>economic order quantity</em> (EOQ) model. This is a relatively simple model defined by:</span></p>

This is the cost incurred each time you submit an order and is often dominated by shipping costs;<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;"><math title="" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mstyle> <mstyle mathsize="0.7em"> <mi>I</mi> </mstyle> </mstyle><annotation encoding="latex">{"version":"1.1","math":"\( \scriptsize I\)"}</annotation></semantics></math> represents the "inventory holding rate". This is the cost to hold an item as a proportion of the item's cost. Quite often, this is dominate by the insurance rate;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;"><math title="" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mstyle> <mstyle mathsize="0.7em"> <mi>C</mi> </mstyle> </mstyle><annotation encoding="latex">{"version":"1.1","math":"\( \scriptsize C \)"}</annotation></semantics></math> is the wholesale cost of the item; and&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">This model can be extended to include items that are purchased in specific lot sizes and the common "Economic Lot Production Size Model" that is used to determine the optimum size of a lot in a manufacturing context.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Stochastic Models</span></strong></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Single Period Stochastic Model - The Newsvendor Model</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Consider the case where we are buying an item for resale and that we will only buy that specific item once (e.g., a promotional item labelled with a date, "2024 Grey Cup"). If we don't buy enough of these t-shirts, we risk running out and consequently missing out on the profit we could have made had we ordered more shirts to sell. Conversely, if we order more shirts that what we can sell, we will end up with leftover inventory that we purchased at whole sale cost and are unable to obtain any profit on. We may even have to pay a disposal fee. The Newsvendor model aspires to achieve an optimal balance between the probability of each of these mutually exclusive events and their associated costs. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Multiple Period Stochastic Models</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">There are two common models used for multiple period ordering. The first is the <em>periodic review and order-up-to&nbsp;</em>model. In this context, a specific period transpires between successive orders. Perhaps I order once every week. Perhaps I order once a month. In these cases, the ordering period is one week and one month, respectively. This stochastic model leverages a probability distribution assigned to the demand function. I can also account for variability in the length of the ordering period and the length of the leadtime period using probability distributions. In this model, the objective is to identify the order-up-to level that will sustain operations throughout the review and leadtime periods at minimum cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">The second commonly used model is&nbsp;<em>continuous review and order-up-to level</em>. This is typical of organizations that have good visibility of their current inventory holdings (e.g., point-of-sale systems and warehouse management systems). In this strategy, the objective is to identify the "reorder point" - or the inventory level that would trigger the next order replenishing your stock. Software will track the volume of goods remaining in-stock and will alert a buyer to the need to order more when the inventory level falls below the reorder point. This model also informs the buyer what purchase volume should be ordered to minimize costs or attain a specified service level.</span></p>
